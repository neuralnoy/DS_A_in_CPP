/* The greatest common divisor, or GCD, of two positive integers n and m is
the largest number j, such that n and m are both multiples of j. Euclid pro-
posed a simple algorithm for computing GCD(n,m), where n > m, which
is based on a concept known as the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The
main idea of the algorithm is to repeatedly perform modulo computations
of consecutive pairs of the sequence that starts (n,m,...), until reaching
zero. The last nonzero number in this sequence is the GCD of n and m.
For example, for n = 80,844 and m = 25,320, the sequence is as follows:
80,844 mod 25,320= 4,884
25,320 mod 4,884= 900
4,884 mod 900= 384
900 mod 384= 132
384 mod 132= 120
132 mod 120= 12
120 mod 12= 0
So, GCD of 80,844 and 25,320 is 12. Write a short C++ function to
compute GCD(n,m) for two integers n and m. */
