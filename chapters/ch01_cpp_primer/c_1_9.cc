// Write a C++ class Vector2, that stores the (x,y) coordinates of a two-
// dimensional vector, where x and y are of type double. Show how to
// override various C++ operators in order to implement the addition of two
// vectors (producing a vector result), the multiplication of a scalar times
// a vector (producing a vector result), and the dot product of two vectors
// (producing a double result).
