// Write a program that consists of three classes, A, B, and C, such that B is a
// subclass of A and C is a subclass of B. Each class should define a member
// variable named “x” (that is, each has its own variable named x). Describe
// a way for a member function in C to access and set A’s version of x to a
// given value, without changing B or C’s version.
